  - title: "🔌 How a CRT displays an image"
    content: |
      Cathode-ray tube (CRT) televisions draw pictures one line at a
      time. An electron beam scans left to right to paint a single
      horizontal line (a scanline), then retraces back to the left and
      draws the next line slightly lower. After reaching the bottom, the
      beam is blanked and steered back to the top to begin the next
      frame.

      The beam’s intensity and color are modulated as it moves, exciting
      phosphors on the glass. Because the beam never “stops,” the video
      signal must be produced in real time and kept in perfect sync with
      the display’s timing.

  - title: "📏 What are scanlines and the beam?"
    content: |
      A scanline is one horizontal sweep of the beam across the screen.
      Classic raster systems do not rely on a full framebuffer. The
      video signal supplies pixel information in the exact moment the
      beam is painting that part of the screen. This tight coupling of
      timing and drawing is sometimes called “racing the beam.”
    list:
      - "Beam: the moving electron spot that paints the image"
      - "Scanline: one horizontal pass of the beam"
      - "HSYNC: timing pulse that starts each new line"
      - "VSYNC: timing pulses that start a new frame"
      - "Horizontal blanking: beam is hidden during retrace to the left"
      - "Vertical blanking: beam is hidden while returning to the top"

  - title: "⏱️ NTSC and PAL timing at a glance"
    content: |
      In NTSC regions, a typical progressive raster frame contains about
      262 lines at roughly 60 Hz. PAL regions typically refresh around
      50 Hz with about 312 lines. The exact visible portion versus the
      blanking intervals can vary by equipment and adjustments, but the
      high level structure is similar:
    ordered_list:
      - "A short vertical sync interval to begin a new frame"
      - "A vertical blanking interval while the beam returns to the top"
      - "A visible region drawn line by line across the screen"
      - "An overscan region near the bottom before the next frame"
    content_after_code: |
      While counts differ between standards, the concepts of sync,
      blanking, and visible drawing are universal to raster CRTs.

  - title: "🧰 Video timing signals and intervals"
    content: |
      Several pieces work together to make a stable raster image:
    list:
      - "Horizontal sync (HSYNC): pulses that start each scanline"
      - "Front/back porch: brief intervals that provide timing margins
        around the visible portion of a line"
      - "Horizontal blanking: the beam is off as it retraces left"
      - "Vertical sync (VSYNC): pulses that mark the start of a frame"
      - "Vertical blanking: the beam is off as it returns to the top"
      - "Overscan/underscan: regions that may be hidden by the bezel or
        display adjustments"

  - title: "🧠 Why understanding CRTs matters"
    content: |
      Knowing how raster displays are generated helps you reason about
      artifacts, calibrate equipment, and interpret retro signals. It is
      also useful when configuring scalers, emulators, and capture gear.
    list:
      - "Artifacts: rolling, tearing, shimmer, or moiré from timing
        issues or scaling"
      - "Phosphor persistence: glow trails and motion characteristics"
      - "Geometry: barrel or pincushion distortion and convergence"
      - "Color encoding: differences between composite, S-Video, and
        component connections"

  - title: "📋 A typical frame structure"
    content: |
      A stable frame follows a repeated rhythm. A short vertical sync
      sequence signals the start of a frame. Then the vertical blanking
      interval allows the beam to move back to the top while remaining
      dark. After that, the visible region is drawn line by line across
      the screen. Finally, an overscan area near the bottom leads into
      the next frame. Consistent timing is essential for a stable image.

  - title: "📚 Key terms to remember"
    list:
      - "Scanline — one horizontal sweep of the beam"
      - "Beam — the electron stream painting the image"
      - "HSYNC — pulse that starts a new scanline"
      - "VSYNC — pulses that start a new frame"
      - "VBLANK — beam hidden; safe time for game logic"
      - "Overscan — lines after drawing, before next frame"
      - "Racing the beam — generating video in lockstep with the beam"

  - title: "🎯 Assignment"
    content: |
      Explore timing concepts without writing code yet. Watch footage of
      color band tests and rolling screens to see how timing errors look
      on a CRT. Then answer the prompts below.
    ordered_list:
      - "Describe the difference between VSYNC and VBLANK in one or two
        sentences"
      - "Sketch a 262-line NTSC frame and label VSYNC, VBLANK, visible,
        and overscan"
      - "List two visible artifacts caused by incorrect timing and what
        likely went wrong"
      - "Summarize how PAL timing differs from NTSC in one paragraph"
